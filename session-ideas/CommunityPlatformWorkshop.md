Droidcon Global Community Platform Discussion

DroidconHQ is creating a global online community platform where developers (droidcon attendees) can connect globally with other
"droidy's", collaborate, discuss (forums), find the coolest international jobs, get news, insights and access content and
videos from all the worldwide droidcons.

The community platform is being built on exo which is an open-source collaboration platforms.

We would like to do a workshop / discussion with members of our Berlin community to discuss what features and functionality
are most important. What will make this digital droidcon home great for you?  What concerns do you have? How are we working
to make this a secure platforms?
